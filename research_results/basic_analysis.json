🔬 Research-Grade I/O Categorizer started!
📊 Measuring: Syscall → VFS → Block amplification
📁 Categories: DATA, METADATA, CONSISTENCY, RELIABILITY, FILESYSTEM, TEMPORARY, ADMIN
🔍 Investigation mode: Detailed amplification analysis enabled


🔍 AMPLIFICATION LAYER #1:
   Process: test_minio_comp (PID 154409, CPU 11)
   Layer: VFS_WRITE
   Context: VFS_WRITE_AMPLIFICATION
   → This VFS operation was triggered by a recent syscall
   → Contributes to I/O amplification measurement


🔍 AMPLIFICATION LAYER #2:
   Process: test_minio_comp (PID 154409, CPU 11)
   Layer: SYSCALL_WRITE
   Context: SYSCALL_WITH_PATH
